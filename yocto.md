# Embedded Systems Overview

## What is an Embedded System?

An **embedded system** is a combination of hardware and software designed to perform a **specific task**.  
Key characteristics:

- Equipped with a processing unit.
- Includes temporary memory and permanent storage.
- Part of a larger system.
- Customized for specific functionality.
- Lower cost compared to general-purpose systems.

Each component in such a system can be considered an embedded system when it has its own processor and memory.

#  Kernel Configuration: `make menuconfig` vs. Yocto Approach

When working with Linux kernel customization for embedded systems, there are two main ways to configure the kernel:

---

## . `make menuconfig` — Traditional Kernel Configuration

This is the **standard method** used when you're working directly with the Linux kernel source **outside** of Yocto.

#  What is Yocto Project?

The **Yocto Project** is an open-source collaboration project that helps developers **create custom Linux distributions** for embedded systems, regardless of the hardware architecture (e.g., ARM, x86).

> Yocto is not a Linux distribution — it's a set of tools for building your own.

##  What Can Be Customized in the Kernel with Yocto?

When using Yocto to build an embedded Linux image, you can **deeply customize the Linux kernel** to fit your device's requirements — from performance to memory footprint.

Here are the major kernel aspects you can customize:

###  1. **Boot Time Optimization**
- Remove unnecessary drivers or features to reduce kernel size.
- Disable debugging or logging features to speed up boot.
- Optimize init system and enable fast boot techniques like `read-only rootfs` or `initramfs`.

###  2. **Memory Usage**
- Disable memory-hungry subsystems not used by your application.
- Use lightweight libraries and a small `C` library like `musl` or `uClibc`.
- Optimize kernel page size and memory allocators (e.g., SLUB vs SLOB).

###  3. **Filesystem Type**
- Choose from multiple filesystems:
  - `ext4`, `squashfs`, `jffs2`, `ubifs`, `cpio`, etc.
- Read-only or read-write depending on use case.
- Enable/disable journaling to save flash wear.

###  4. **Device Drivers**
- Only include drivers relevant to your hardware (I2C, SPI, GPIO, UART, USB, etc.).
- Disable unneeded drivers to reduce image size and attack surface.
- Add support for custom drivers via `.bbappend` and `.cfg`.

###  5. **Security Features**
- Enable kernel hardening options:
  - Stack protector
  - ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization)
  - SELinux or AppArmor
- Remove legacy or unused protocols to reduce attack surface.

###  6. **Processor and Architecture Specific Settings**
- Set correct CPU type (e.g., Cortex-A53, A72).
- Optimize for single-core or multi-core systems.
- Enable hardware floating point, NEON support, etc.

###  7. **Kernel Features and Subsystems**
- Networking stack features (IPv6, VLAN, etc.)
- Filesystem features (overlayfs, squashfs compression)
- USB gadget support, HID, CAN, BLE, etc.
- Real-time kernel features (PREEMPT-RT patch)

### 8. **Init System**
- Use minimal init systems like `busybox`, `systemd`, or `SysV`.
- Customize init scripts to boot directly into your application.
